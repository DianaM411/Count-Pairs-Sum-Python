# Count-Pairs-Sum-Python
Write a program in Python that takes a list of integers as input and outputs the number of pairs of integers in the list that sum to a given target value. The program should take two inputs: a list of integers and a target integer. It should output the number of pairs of integers in the list that sum to the target integer.

For example, if the input list is [2, 3, 5, 7, 8] and the target value is 10, the program should output 2, since there are two pairs of integers that sum to 10: (2, 8) and (3, 7).

You should write the program using efficient algorithms and data structures to ensure that it can handle large input lists efficiently. You may assume that the input list is not sorted, and that the integers in the list are unique.
